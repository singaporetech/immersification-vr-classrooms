# Guidelines for Using VR HMDs in General Classroom Settings

This repository simply consists of a README that consolidates some guidelines with regards to using Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays (VR HMDs) in general classroom settings, as opposed to using them for specific specialized tasks. This work is primarily based on an expert evaluation and a user study with students in the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).

## Guidelines

### Consider context and teaching purpose in the use of VR to promote self-confidence

The tested VR environment can present some specific advantages over other mediums, such as in practice sessions for students who acknowledge that they are apprehensive or too self-conscious when delivering oral presentations. 

However, ultimately, face-to-face engagement is perceived to be more expressive in terms of non-verbal cues. Therefore, there should be a clear context and purpose for the use of VR which cannot be implemented using face-to-face instruction. The scaffolding provided using VR can be faded as the students gain more proficiency and confidence in delivering oral presentations, when face-to-face settings can be arranged for further development. 

Additionally, in scenarios in which a face-to-face setting is not possible, the tested VR environment can present an acceptable alternative, which generally perceived to be more engaging and more effective than video conferencing settings, given the implementation of non-verbal cues in the avatar.

## Consider customizability of avatars and environments to facilitate learning experiences

Feedback from the participants favored the customizability of avatars, seating arrangements and multiple room environments that could be used to enhance the experience. The ability to reflect one's self in the avatar is inclusive, and contained an element of fun. Non verbal cues being reflected in an avatar's performance also allowed participants to improve their team-based interactions. 

In the expert evaluation, it was also noted that the flexibility of seating formats and spaces, and ability to scribble on the whiteboard was a factor in the choice of VR software. Although there is room for further improvement in the current VR software, most notably around the ability to take notes, either on whiteboards or with the use of a keyboard, these existing possibilities could be improved upon in the future
